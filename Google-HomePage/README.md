Task:
For this mini-project, youâ€™ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.

Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out (or try using CodePen or jsfiddle.net).
